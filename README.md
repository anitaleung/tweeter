Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to respond to a tweet
2. How to draft new tweet

## Notes

This one admittedly took a long time to finish, got stuck caught up trying to make the retweet and favorite buttons work as well as loading the user profile image properly.
